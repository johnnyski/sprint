README for NCAR SPRINT v1.22 (11/30/06)
=============================================

NCAR SPRINT interpolator.

Note:  This package is different from NCAR's distribution.  It does not
       require the NCAR graphics package.  All routines that SPRINT used
       from the NCAR graphics library, namely the bit manipulation routines,
       are included directly.

       The source code in this package is configured for Linux, particularly
       files cedric.h and dorade.h.  The NCAR distribution includes versions
       of this code for other platforms which are not included in this package.
