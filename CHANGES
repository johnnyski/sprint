sprint/CHANGES:

v1.23 (01/12/07)
---------------------
1. Added Huntsville (KHTX) site to INPFIL.f.

v1.22 (11/30/06)
---------------------
1. INPFIL.f: Now includes all NEXRAD sites.

v1.21 (3/29/06)
---------------------
1. Added Sterling (KLWX) and Dover AFB (KDOX) sites to src/INPFIL.f.

v1.20 (3/3/05)
---------------------
1. Changed configure.in to include compiler option '-fno-automatic' in FFLAGS
   when compiler is g77.  This is like the '-static' option in other FORTRAN
   compilers: it forces static storage of local variables.

v1.19 (2/3/05)
---------------------
1. Added Los Angeles (KVTX) and Santa Ana Mountains (KSOX) sites to
   src/INPFIL.f.

v1.18 (10/20/03)
---------------------
1. Added Norfolk (KAKQ) site to src/INPFIL.f.

v1.17 (10/6/03)
---------------------
1. Revised README concerning location of SPRINT documentation, and added note
   about package's Linux specific code.
2. Restored "cedric.h,v" and "dorade.h,v" in CVS repository to ensure their
   inclusion in checkout.  These are adaptations by J. Merritt of files
   from the linux subdirectory.

v1.16 (9/9/03)
---------------------
1. Dave Makofski cleaned up nonstandard format statements in FORTRAN routines.
2. Modified configure.in for autoconf 2.53.

v1.15 (5/9/00)
---------------------
1. Put "FFLAGS = -g -static -O2" in configure.in; will go into Makefile build.
2. Added Makefile.am for automake/configure.
3. Copied current versions of  CEDLOG.f, cedric.h, dorade.h into sprint/src.
4. Can now use "make dist" to build tar file for distribution.

v1.14 (7/13/00)
---------------------
1. Edited README to include  FFLAGS = "-g -static" 
2. Added new radar site numbers to src/INPFIL.f.

v1.13 (12/21/99)
---------------------
1. Uses configure.
2. Endianess is determined via configure.

v1.12 (7/24/97)
---------------------
1. New radar site numbers.  These are in src/INPFIL.f.

v1.11 (2/6/97)
---------------------
1. New intrinsics.c for linux.  This is for proper build with f2c/f77.


v1.10 (1/16/97)
---------------------
1. Make the directions for installation more clear in Makefile.
2. Modified src/linux/Makefile1 in order to build by gvbox's makefile.

v1.9 (12/27/96)
---------------------
1. Minor mod. in the Makefile and linux/Makefile.1

v1.8 (Froze: 12/13/96)
---------------------
1. Traps signals.

v1.7 (Froze: 03/28/96)
---------------------
1. Changed the makefiles -- now $MACHINE/Makefile.1 contains only 
   machine-dependent definitions.
2. Eliminated 'fclose' calls for SGI machines.  See #if in COUT.c.
   Doing this prevents a 'broken pipe' error which causes a core dump.
   Yes, I tried to trap SIGPIPE, but, it wouldn't take.

v1.6 (Froze: 3/20/96)
---------------------
1. Very minor diagnositc mods. In gzip.c. -JHM

v1.5 (Froze: 3/14/96)
---------------------
1. Updated Makefile.1 for each machine except linux.

v1.4 (Froze: 3/5/96)
----------------------
1. Reads gzip-ed input UF files.  This file pointer, after it is opened
   the first time, may not be reused; no seeking.  However, the
   code to reuse the file pointers is still part of sprint.
   See CINITCOS.c for location for the gzip pipe initialization.

v1.3 (Froze: 3/5/96)
----------------------
- Compiles and runs on Linux using f2c. Also, see the note.  JHM 3/4/96
- Removed nearly all compilier warning.  Only trivial stuff.

Note: 3/4/96 -- John Merritt

This version works on big and little endian machines.  Some rewritten routines
are included.  See the files: CINITCOS.c and COUT.c.

The byte-order problem still exists and I have only provided a simple kludge
fix.  The problem is that output values are half-word swapped.  I've added
a function called 'two_byte_swap' which swaps pairs of 16 bits.  This 
produces an output file that when processed by 2A-54 and 2A-55, their output
results are the same for big-endian or little-endian.  In other words, 
the output of SPRINT is not binary compatable between big and little 
endian machines; this should be resolved so that the output file is
identical on both.

However, In order to make the output file binary endian-independant,
all programs that read the sprint output will need to be modified, in
their input section, to swap bytes appropriately.  This may be too
problematic.

Additionally, the output MUDRAS file has some obvious byte (or half-word)
swapping problem.  Most notably, in the headers.

A new directory is included, linux/.  It contains files specific for
operation on Linux.   Linux, typically, runs on little-endian machines.


v1.2 (Froze: 3/1/96)
----------------------
- New source from Stacy (1/9/96). This version supports base scan 
  interpolation.
- No longer depends on the NCAR graphics libraries
- Removed doc and example.

v1.1 (Froze: 9/8/95)
--------------------
